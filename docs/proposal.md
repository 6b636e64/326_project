# Innovative Idea

Our idea is to create an web app called Side Hustles that allows students to practice their skills (such as cutting hair, designing websites, sewing help, creating greeting cards etc.) and also purchase products or services at an amateur rate or through an exchange of goods or services. 

This application pulls inspiration from Etsy and Amazon. Etsy, as an amateur-focused ecommerce site, is the closest inspiration for Side Hustles. However, Jellyworks aims to narrow the focus of Etsy even more to cater specifically to the college audience with the emphasis on buying from students in the user's area. We drew UI inspiration from Amazon, specifically around the product pages such as with our "Things Like This" section in our product page.
